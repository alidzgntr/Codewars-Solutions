# Codewars-Solutions
My solutions to Codewars challenges written in Python.
My goal is to improve my **analytical thinking** skills by practicing algorithms.  
At this stage, Iâ€™m not focusing on performance or optimization â€” instead, I want to understand every step **logically and clearly**.

Thatâ€™s why I often avoid using built-in or ready-made functions and prefer to write my own code.  
The main purpose of this repository is to strengthen my **problem-solving** and **analytical thinking** abilities through consistent practice.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Most solutions are written in **Python**.  
- Code is written step by step for better understanding.  
- The focus is on **learning the logic**, not on writing the shortest code.
